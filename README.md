# Undermine
Functionality for gauging semantic correlation between symbols/variables/terms across multiple commits/change sets.  
It extracts enough semantic data from your source to stop code from being committed or merged when there's a good chance that the resulting output would be nonsensical. 

## Is Undermine Right for Me?
You have a high volume of gated commits--or you would, except that you have to manually merge the team's work back into the trunk, resolve conflicts and generally waste time.

By delegating conflict resolution to an an automated process that can handle semantic values or a numerical approximation thereof, you leave such waste and ugliness behind.

##  TL;DR
Let Undermine sanity check your team before they sneak their comedy gold into the repository.
